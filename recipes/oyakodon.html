    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Enjoy one of Japan’s most popular and easy-to-make fast food dishes in the comfort of your own home. Oyakodon is a one-bowl meal consisting of a bed of rice topped with chicken and egg (hence the name ‘oyako’, meaning ‘parent and child’) and seasoned with soy sauce, mirin, and dashi. A guaranteed mealtime favourite, we recommend you serve this as soon as you finish making it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>150ml dashi stock</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>pinch of sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>500g cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 spring onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Cut the chicken into pieces:</b>
            We need to prepare the chicken first so cut up 200g chicken into small bite-size pieces. </li>
        <li><b>Prepare the sauce:</b> 
            Add 150ml dashi stock to your oyakodon pan or frying pan and heat before adding 1 tbsp mirin and 1 tbsp soy sauce plus a pinch of sugar. Bring to the boil and then simmer on medium heat. Now is also a good time to start cooking your rice separately so that it is ready for when you finish cooking the dish.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the chicken:</b>
            Once the soup has been simmering for a few minutes, add your pieces of chicken and cook. Once the chicken is done, about 10-12 minutes, chop up a whole onion into thin slices and add them to the pan.</li>
        <li><b>Add the eggs:</b> 
            Beat 2 eggs in a bowl, then pour into the pan and let it cook for a few minutes. Try not to let the egg cook too much, about 1-2 minutes, a slightly runny texture is the preferred way to serve oyakodon.</li>
        <li><b>Serve and enjoy:</b> When the eggs are done, turn off the heat and pour the egg and chicken over a bowl of freshly boiled white rice. Garnish with some finely sliced spring onions before serving, enjoy.</li>
